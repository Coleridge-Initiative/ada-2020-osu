# Applied Data Analytics - OSU Spring 2020 Training Course
Repository for the Spring 2020 OSU training program focused on Transitions in Education and Workforce, which was taught in SQL and Python.

## Projects
Participants in this program were grouped into teams of 5 or fewer and created projects in hopes of understanding the labor market outcomes of individuals who acquired post secondary degrees and credentials in Ohio. Some project questions teams addressed were:

  - Which programs of study at Ohio community colleges result in the best labor market outcomes?
  - Do those who complete welding courses have better employment outcomes than those who enroll but do not complete these courses?
  - To what extent is there a relationship between credential creep and wages in nursing within Ohio?
  - What in-demand majors provide the most value to Ohio based on in-state employment and mean income, and which institutions provided these graduates?
